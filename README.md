## Getting Started

### Powering On

1. Insert a fresh 9V battery into the back compartment.
2. Slide the switch to the **ON** position.
3. Ensure the **Low Battery** LED is **not** lit (replace if necessary).
4. Wait 15 minutes for thermal stabilization.
5. Measure outputs at terminal block using a precision DMM.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is a **voltage reference**, **not** a power supply. Do not exceed the 10 mA output limit.

## Calibration Guide

1. Insert a fresh 9V battery.
2. Let the unit stabilize for **1 hour**.
3. Connect to a precision voltmeter.
4. If needed, remove the RF shield carefully.
5. Adjust the trimmer screw near the top-left corner (1/4 turn ‚âà 5 ¬µV).
6. Allow the output to stabilize, then repeat as necessary.
7. Replace the RF shield after completion.

**Recommended Tools**:
- Keysight 34420A / Keithley 2182A
- Fluke 732 Reference or equivalent
- Bourns H-90 trimmer tool (1.8 mm)

## Reducing Noise & EMF

To maintain accuracy:
- Avoid nearby wireless devices (phones, routers, etc.)
- Avoid fluorescent lighting and switching power supplies
- Use low-EMF test leads (e.g., gold-plated copper)
- Handle carefully to prevent thermal EMF from dissimilar metals
